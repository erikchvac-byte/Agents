I'm returning with results from WP3 execution by a local LLM. We're implementing an MCP server using a work package approach.

WORKFLOW: You (Lead Architect Claude) plan work packages → I run them with local LLM → I bring results back → You review and plan next WP.

COMPLETED:
- WP1: MCP SDK installed ✅
- WP2: MCP server entry point created ✅ (you fixed import issues)
- WP3: AgentManager singleton ⏳ (local LLM just executed)

YOUR JOB: Review WP3_DELIVERABLES.md (attached below), assess PASS/FAIL against success metrics, then either fix issues or prepare WP4.

SUCCESS METRICS FOR WP3:
- No TS errors (excluding node_modules/AGENT_TOOLS)
- Singleton pattern implemented
- All 19 agents imported
- executeTool routes correctly
- verify-wp3.sh passed

FULL CONTEXT: Read C:\Users\erikc\Dev\Agents\HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_CLAUDE.md for complete details.
